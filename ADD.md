GroupSafe -- by Mike Kane


##Objective

GroupSafe is an app that allows groups of people to travel safely and receive a notification when any group member gets to far away from the group. 

##Audience

GroupSafe's primary target audience is men and women in their 20s that like to go out together to social events, such as bar hopping or to a large concert where the group still wants to stick together. 

##Experience

When users open the app, they will be prompted to either create a group, or join a group by entering a group code.  The first user will create the group, which will generate a group code.  This user will also specify a maximum distance users can get from the center of the group before an alert goes out.  They will give this group code to their friends, who will then join the group as well.  Users will then enter optional contact info, such as a phone number.  

The app will then run silently in the background. At any time, users may open the app and see a localized map of the group, and where all other groups members are in relationship to them. If any user gets farther from the group than the maximum specified distance, the app will alert them that they have left the group.  An alert will be sent out to all users in the group letting them know that user is longer physically near the group.  

For the user that triggered the alert, a notification will pop up letting them know that they have left the group, along with a message box so that they can message the other group members--for instance, to say "I'm heading home" so that the other group members dont have to worry.  

When users receive an alert that a friend has left the group, the notification will take them to a map that shows that missing user's current location.  They will also be presented with the ability to call, message (within the app), or text (in iMessage) to make sure that they are okay.
